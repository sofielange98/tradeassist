Meeting with sponsors 11-21-2018

more concerned with time series component than class labels
how to treat "independent" inputs over time, in the best way with memory

look into the amount of time-series data per dataset and see which has the most time-series info 

possibly use different datasets and compare performance across them

Possible Data Sets

nuScenes
- Very granular - Multiperspective (cameras and car POV)
- 3d bounding boxes
- lidar/radar/keyframes available
labels include 
-- vehicle.bus.bendy
-- vehicle.bus.rigid
-- vehicle.trailer
-- vehicle.truck


ApolloScape
- 3D point cloud - could construct bounding box?
- pretty granular, labels are chinese car models, also include class eg (sedan, car)
- eye-level/car view

YouTube-bb
-Less granular, 2D bounding boxes
-Subset of COCO labels
-hand-held phone camera angle
-preprocess to only include vehicle labels (bus, car, truck, motorcycle)

City Cam
-Frame by frame annotation with 2D bounding boxes
-highly granular labels ()
-Traffic surveillance footage - lots of objects within frame
