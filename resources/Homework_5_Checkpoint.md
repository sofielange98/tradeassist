# Homework 5 Checkpoint

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

## Original Homework Plan

> "The app will be able to execute all functionality at this point and will also have a user-friendly interface which makes sense and looks polished for signing up for the service and checking status of strategy"

Also, from last checkpoint
1. Create edit strategies page
2. debugging with api calls
3. format the emails
4. polish up from end
5. descriptions of strategies
6. refactor app initialization

## What I Completed

The app can pretty much do everything I want it to do at this point! 
I accomplished tasks 1-6, minus 5. I think the style looks really good, the emails will take a little more formatting if I have the time, and I definitely could spend some more time debugging. 

I haven't turned the strategies into factory pattern yet and still need to work on breaking the code out into a mailer object instead of just having it wherever doing whatever. 

## Plan for next checkpoint

1. Mailer object
2. Unit tests!!! Im not sure why but the structure of my directory is not making travis happy
3. Practice demo and create architecture diagram 
4. Maybe add some extra strategies and symbols?
